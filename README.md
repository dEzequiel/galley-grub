# Galley Grub

Thanks to my mentor [David Gelpi](https://github.com/dfleta) for creating and instructing this exercise. The official repository can be found [here](https://github.com/dfleta/examen-galley-grub) with David UML Class diagram.

Some tests are made by [David Gelpi](https://github.com/dfleta) too and the 'Extras' package is made with help from my class partner [Nicolau Joan](https://github.com/nicolaujoan)
